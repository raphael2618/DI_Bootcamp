    //1.the outcome of a+b will be 23 because the variable a is now 2. So 2 + 21 =23
    //2.the value of c is nothing because we don't initialize it never.
    console.log(3 + 4 + '5');
    //3.The outcome of this code will be : 75 because 3 and 4 are numbers so there will be add together
    //but 5 is a string so it will be concatenate with 7.
